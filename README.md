# Basement Nightclub - Lighting

Notes, calibration data and a 3D model for the lighting rig in a basement DJ room. The rig is run with **SoundSwitch 2.11** and a **Control One**, using about 20 DMX fixtures on one universe.

The rebuild started 2026-10-05. It works in this order:
1. **Map the room** and place every light in 3D. Done.
2. **Validate fixtures and DMX addresses.** Done.
3. **Calibrate the movers** to shared named positions, so they aim where you expect. In progress.
4. **Build the looks and Autoloops.** Next.

## Conventions
- **Viewpoint:** stand at the back (mirror-ball wall), facing the speakers. Left and right are from there.
- **Numbering starts at the front, by the speakers.**
- **Units:** inches. X is measured from the left I-beam, Y from the mirror-ball wall, and Z is height off the floor.
- **Fixture names:** prefix plus DMX start address. F = front bar, C = ceiling Tripar (C1 is nearest the speakers), L/R = left/right I-beam, W = speaker wall. Example: "L2 Scan 160".
