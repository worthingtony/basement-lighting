# Studio 841 - lighting

Tony's basement nightclub is called **Studio 841** (the custom 841 gobo reads "841 STUDIO"). This repo covers its DJ room lighting, run with SoundSwitch 2.11 and a Control One. The sound system is a separate repo (`tonyinwi/basement-sound`).

## Working rules
- **Ask before anything risky or hard to undo.** That includes deleting fixtures or looks, Options > Update Fixtures, Reset Default Autoloops, and Export to Control One.
- **Save after every fixture:** press OK, then File > Save Project. **Saving only works in Edit mode.** In Perform mode the File menu has no Save, and "Import from Control One" sits where Save would be. Don't click it.
- **Static Look Bank 4 is Claude's** for tests and calibration. Bank 1 Autoloops can be overwritten, since Tony will rebuild all the Autoloops anyway.
- **Tony moves fixtures by hand, and only left/right and up/down.** Everything else is done in software. When he says he'll "point it" or "move it", he usually means dragging the dot in SoundSwitch himself. Hand him the steps and keep off the Mac until he says done.
- Give directions by **DMX address**. Number and list fixtures **from the front (speakers)**. Describe the room **as seen from the back**, facing the speakers.
- Use regular hyphens in writing, not em dashes.
- After each session, update the notes and `notes/session-log.md`, then commit.

## How Tony wants Autoloops built (his feedback after the 2026-10-06 demo)
- **An Autoloop is an "active look": a coordinated look with one feeling.** It can use more than one color, but the colors are chosen to go together (a palette), never random. It's not an animation that cycles through things.
- **Slow color changes.** The stock Autoloops changed color far too fast.
- **Respect the color wheels.** Wheel fixtures (Spots, Scan 360s, Vortex) should hold a color, not spin through the wheel.
- Movement and intensity can breathe with the music. The color and the character of the look stay put for the whole loop.
- **Program in stacks.** A bank is a stack of looks that flow well into each other, like Bank 1 = one stack. Order them so each one transitions nicely to the next.
- **Keep genres apart.** Dance/tech house (EDM) and 80s are separate stacks in separate banks. Never plan a transition between them.
- **Tony's notes after reviewing the overnight build (2026-10-07):**
  - **Pocket Beam:** use it only on the tiny ball, and only as a "hit" accent. Take it out of everything else.
  - **Spots:** use them more aggressively.
  - **Floor wash:** step the Tripars down the floor (chase) instead of always flashing them together.
  - **Prisms:** use them (Spots and Scan 360s).
  - **Brightness:** about 50% brighter overall, with more lights on or intensity up.
  - **Order:** #4 Call and Answer is too much red right after Cherry Bounce.
  - **Movement:** more of it, generally.
  - **Before building anything new:** Tony wants to research the new Autoloop features, then program a scene himself so Claude can see how he does it.
- **Design in space, not all-on.** Think about how each light reads in the room next to the others. Use lights on their own or in small groups: a lone beam, just the I-beam scans, only the front bar. Don't run everything all the time. Leave darkness and contrast, and look for clever single-light moments.

## Current state (2026-10-06)
- **Patch:** validated and named. Groups are set: a pair shares a group, and a one-off gets its own. Full table in `notes/rig.md`.
- **Positions:**
  - Floor Center and Front of Floor are camera-checked.
  - Tiny Ball has only the Pocket Beam aimed.
  - Back of Floor and Cross are camera-checked (2026-10-06). Cross is now a wide X with separate pools.
  - Lanes and Ball are done (2026-10-06). In Ball the Pocket Beam lights the big ball; it sits on the tiny ball in every other position.
  - "841 Logo" is done: Spot 1 throws the custom 841 gobo (value 36) onto the wall behind the bar, with a slow spin (Gobo Rotation 10). It aims only Spot 1, so never put it on the Main Track. Tony (2026-10-07): **the logo can go in Autoloops, strategically**, as a moment rather than wallpaper. The way to do it is a Position Override on Spot 1's track only (Shift+P), plus the gobo as an attribute cue.
  - Spot 1 gobo map: `notes/calibration.md`.
- **Autoloops (in Claude-0000.ssproj):**
  - Bank 1 is the hand-built EDM / tech house stack: Blue Hour, Scissors, Cherry Bounce, Call and Answer, The Sweep, Spiral Peak, One Beam, Blue Return.
  - **Correction:** each bank holds 32 Autoloops, and clicking a bank's name in the Autoloop panel switches banks. The 5 "80s" looks were built in **Bank 1 slots 9-13**, not Bank 2 (confirmed 2026-10-07). They need moving to the real Bank 2, to keep the genres apart.
  - **Bank 3 slots 1-8 (Claude-2100.ssproj):** the round 2 EDM stack, "R2 1" to "R2 8".
- **Static Look "841"** (Bank 4, row 2 slot 3) puts the spinning 841 logo on the wall behind the bar. Switch it on over any Autoloop.
- **Static Look "Mirror Ball"** (Bank 4, row 2 slot 4): Saber on the big ball, Pocket Beam on the little ball.
- **Static Look "Vortex Show"** (Bank 4) runs the Vortex's built-in program (Show 134) with a medium barrel spin. Switch it on alongside the Autoloops. The Autoloops can't change the Vortex by themselves.
- **Static Looks "Vortex Slow / Medium / Fast"** (Bank 4, row 4) are the same show at three Show Speeds and barrel speeds. **"841 Fade"** (row 3, slot 2) is the logo with 2 s fades. Details: `notes/calibration.md`.
- **Mac setup:**
  - Project file: `/Users/tonyw/Dropbox/SoundSwitch/Claude-1020.ssproj` (newest). Always use the **disk venue**. The USB venue is the Control One copy.
  - For calibration, the Ring "Dance floor" camera on the back wall faces the speakers. Claude watches its Live View in the Claude app's built-in browser (account.ring.com, signed in) and restarts it when it times out (about every 5 minutes). A phone photo from the back is best for checking overlap.

## Next up
**Morning of 2026-10-08 - start here.** The newest file is `/Users/tonyw/Dropbox/SoundSwitch/Claude-2100.ssproj`. It's Claude-0000 plus last night's work:
- **Bank 3 slots 1-8: the round 2 EDM stack** ("R2 1 Deep Blue" to "R2 8 Blue Return"), built with Autoscript and then hand-edited to Tony's notes. Compare it with round 1 in Bank 1 slots 1-8. See `notes/stacks.md`, "Round 2".
- **Static Looks Bank 4:** Vortex Slow / Medium / Fast (row 4) and 841 Fade (row 3, slot 2). The pulsing logo is the Autoloop "R2 7 841 Breakdown".
- Autoscript notes: `notes/autoscript.md`.
- None of it has been seen on the lights. Run Bank 3 with music, BPM on and haze.
- Claude-0000 is unchanged (round 1 only). Claude.ssproj is the 2026-10-06 22:10 fallback.

- **Start here (after 2026-10-20 evening):** working project **`/Users/tonyw/Dropbox/SoundSwitch/Claude-1020.ssproj`**. Party is **Saturday 2026-10-24** (80s/90s 1 h, tech house headliner 2 h, 80s/90s to close; DJs bring laptops, Ableton Link hoped for); Tony wants it done Friday. Done 10-20: Scan 110 and Vortex color profiles applied, hazer on DMX, Haze Low/Med/High and Pocket White looks, Pocket Beam re-aimed except Ball. **Open, in order:** (1) Tony aims Pocket Beam on Ball; (2) check the Autoloops' global "smoke" cue (could fire the hazer), and set it to 0, since Tony wants haze manual; (3) check that the existing Autoloops and Vortex looks survived Update Fixtures; (4) Link test with a DJ laptop; (5) Tony Autoscripts a Virtual DJ track so Claude can learn his method; (6) the design conversation (`notes/stacks.md`, 2026-10-20) before building stacks. Clicking goes through `tools/ui.py` while Claude 3.1623.0's click tool is broken (`notes/fixes-and-issues.md`); release full-screen control while using it.

0. **Tony's note:** pressing Black leaves the Vortex running when Vortex Show is on. See `notes/fixes-and-issues.md`; the test plan is Job V1 in `notes/handoff-fixture-profiles.md`.
1. Add Lanes and Ball cues to some Bank 1 Autoloops (they were cued before those positions existed).
2. **DJ booth:** now set up at the front of the dance floor, on the **left as seen from the back** (Tony's "stage right": his right when standing behind the front bar facing the room). Spot 1 can't aim at the booth (tried 2026-10-06). Tony will check whether he has a second 841 gobo; if so, it needs a fixture that can reach the booth (Spot 14 is worth testing first). An unused "DJ Booth" position and an empty look "99" (Bank 4, row 3 slot 1) are left over from the attempt and aren't saved yet.
3. Check L3 171 alone at Back of Floor and Cross.
4. Map the Vortex's colors in Fixture Manager, so Autoloops can color it. Its gobo wheel (ch3) is its color wheel: Job V2 in `notes/handoff-fixture-profiles.md`. Try more Show programs: there are only 6, at Show values 31, 62, 93, 124, 155, 186 (the current 134 is Show 4) and 228 for random.
5. Add position cues to the Bank 2-4 Autoloops, or build the custom "Groove" Autoloop:
   - Tripars on a slow color wash
   - Movers easing between Floor Center and Front of Floor
   - Vortex spinning
   - Pocket Beam on the tiny ball
   - Saber on the big ball
   - No strobe
6. Cleanup:
   - Delete the stray looks: "113" (twice) and "105" in Bank 4, "98" in Bank 4 and "1" in Bank 1.
   - Set every fixture's signal-loss behavior to Blackout.
   - File > Export to Control One.
7. Hardware:
   - Repair R3 204 (it's already programmed).
   - Fix the hazer's DMX.
   - Re-add one Pocket Roll.
   - Consider another LED pinspot (or a pinhole gobo) for the big ball.
   - Measure where the tiny ball and the Fog Fury are, and add them to the 3D model.
   - Track down the idle glow on the Vortex and the Scan 110s. The Vortex's own display (Information > DMXValue) shows what it receives, so it can stand in for a DMX tester.
8. Back up `Claude.ssproj` and the custom Fixture Manager profile ("Intimidator Scan 360 Rev 2 tony") into this repo.
