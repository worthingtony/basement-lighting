# Rig: room, fixtures, patch

## Room geometry
Units are inches. X is measured from the left I-beam, Y from the mirror-ball wall, and Z is height off the floor. Left and right are as seen from the back, facing the speakers.

| Item | Measurement |
|---|---|
| I-beam to I-beam | 187" (15'7"), centers |
| Mirror-ball wall to speaker wall | 378" (31'6") by laser. An earlier tape measure gave 30'10". |
| Joists | 86" (7'2") |
| I-beam bottoms | 76" (6'4"). The I-beam does not run all the way to the back wall. |
| Centerline | X 93.5", the Tripar line. Everything centers on it. |
| Mirror ball | 16" ball, top at 79", 12" off the left I-beam, at the back wall |
| Front bar | 16" (1'4") off the speaker wall (Y 362), bottom at 80" (6'8") |
| DJ booth | Moved 2026-10-06: now at the front of the dance floor, on the left seen from the back (see the note below). Earlier it sat off to the side. |

**Other details:**
- All Scan 110s hang at 6'7". They are spaced about 5' (60") apart along each beam.
- **DJ booth (2026-10-06):** set up at the front of the dance floor, on the **left as seen from the back**. Tony calls it "stage right": his right when standing behind the front bar (the lighting bar) facing the room, so the left as seen from the lounge. Not measured yet. It replaces the earlier idea of using the mini bar.
- **Tiny mirror ball:** sits in front of the Fog Fury and is lit by the Pocket Beam. Its exact position hasn't been measured yet.

**Not patched:**
- **Pocket Rolls:** removed. One was moved to another part of the basement and should be re-added.
- **Laser** (to the right of Spot 14): not enabled and not patched.

## SoundSwitch project
- SoundSwitch 2.11 with a Control One.
- **Project file:** `/Users/tonyw/Dropbox/SoundSwitch/Claude.ssproj`
- **Venues:** the **disk venue** is the working copy. The **USB venue** is the Control One copy, which needs File > Export to Control One to update.
- **Saving:** fixtures, looks, positions and Autoloops save with **File > Save Project**, which only exists in Edit mode. Save Lightshow (Cmd-S) saves the current track's script.
