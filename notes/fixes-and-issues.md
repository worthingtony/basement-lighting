# Fixes and open issues

## Fixes made
- **Shocker glowed at idle.** Its 5ch profile left ch 4-5 unmapped, which fired Auto Program. Fixed by moving it from 136 to 417 in 8ch Mode 3 (the unit was re-addressed).
- **F4 Scan360 315 did a slow strobe.** The profile's strobe range had R start 8. Changed it to 4 in Fixture Manager, since 4-7 = open. Then File > Save Workspace, then Options > Update Fixtures.
- **F4 lost its name and group** after that profile update. It was renamed "F4 Scan360 315" and set back to Mover Primary Group 2.
- **R1 182 lost its address and mode.** The fixture menu "Reset" was a factory reset. Re-entered 182 / 11CH.
- **L1 149's pool was fuzzy.** A fixture-menu reset fixed it, probably the gobo wheel position.
- **F2 300 was knocked.** Its mirror was hit, so it was reset and re-aimed.
- **Everything was lit with a purple tint.** Unplugging the Control One didn't help. Quitting and relaunching SoundSwitch did.
- **Stock Autoloops never moved the movers.** They had no working position cues. Bank 1 now has cues (see `calibration.md`).
- **Vortex was stuck on one look.** The "Vortex Show" static look runs its built-in program instead.

## Open issues
- **Claude desktop 3.1623.0 breaks computer use on SoundSwitch and Fixture Manager (2026-10-20).** Clicks fail with "Could not verify which document this window is editing"; the windows return kAXErrorNoValue for AXDocument. Screenshots still work. Workarounds: roll back to Claude 2.42304.2 (and don't quit Claude, or the updater reinstalls 3.x), or Tony clicks with Claude directing. A click helper using CoreGraphics events is in `tools/ui.py`, but auto mode blocks it unless Tony adds an allow rule.
- **Scan 110 Claude wheel is mapped by hue, but the gobos are real colors.** Re-map it before Update Fixtures (see `session-log.md`, 2026-10-20).
- **Fixture Manager workspace has a stray "Intimidator Scan 110 (Colors)" copy** (GUID 7D4DA6E3, unused by the patch). Harmless; delete when convenient.
- **Black doesn't stop the Vortex (2026-10-06 demo).** With Vortex Show on, pressing Black on the Control One leaves the Vortex running. Likely cause: Vortex Show runs the fixture's built-in program (ch 7, Show 134), which seems to ignore the dimmer that Black pulls to 0. Ideas: once the Vortex has a color wheel in its profile, drive it from the Autoloops and Static Looks instead of its built-in show; or test whether Black also zeroes the shutter channel. The manual shows ch5 Shutter has a real closed range (0-31). Test plan: Job V1 in `notes/handoff-fixture-profiles.md`.
- **SoundSwitch froze after a save (2026-10-06 21:08)** with the Edit-mode File menu drawn open. Force Quit and relaunch fixed it, and nothing saved was lost.
- **The Vortex can't be colored by the Autoloops.** Its SoundSwitch profile exposes no color channels (the Color cell in Static Looks is blank). Per the manual, its colors come from the colored gobos on ch3 ("Gobo / Color Wheel"), so the fix is to map ch3 as a color wheel: Job V2 in `notes/handoff-fixture-profiles.md`. Barrel Rotation, Show and Reflector Rotation are attributes, and the Autoloops never animate them. To fix:
  - Map its color channels in Fixture Manager.
  - Add attribute cues in our own Autoloops.
  - Meanwhile, use Vortex Show.
- **Idle glow:** the Vortex 405 and the Scan 110s glow white at idle in Edit mode with nothing programmed. Their profiles are fully mapped. Next step is a DMX tester.
- **The hazer (141) doesn't respond to DMX.** Suspects are the wireless bridge and the DIP switches. Running it manually for now.
- **R3 204 is broken.** It's programmed and waiting for repair.
- **WiFLY name:** the WiFLY's name won't change in SoundSwitch.
- **Stray static looks:** "113" (twice) and "105" in Bank 4, "98" in Bank 4, and "1" in Bank 1.
- **QLC+** was looked at and ruled out (2026-10-07). See `qlcplus.md`.
