# Session log

## 2026-10-05
- Room measured with tape and laser. 3D model built (`model/basement-rig-map.html`).
- Patch validated, fixtures renamed, groups set.
- Shocker idle glow and F4 slow strobe fixed.
- CAL Test look (Bank 4) and the Floor Center position created.
- **~21:33** SoundSwitch dropped to the home screen after Update Fixtures, and unsaved edits were lost. New rule: OK + Save Project after every fixture.
- **22:14** Front bar Floor Center done: F1, F5, F2 and F4, with Spot 14, 300 and 315 re-aimed physically.
- **After 22:14** L1/R1 done.
- **22:40** L2/R2 done, with a clean overlap.
- **22:49** L3 fine-tuned against R2. R3 programmed (broken). **Floor Center complete for all movers.**
- **22:51** Agreed on the position list: Front of Floor, Back of Floor, Lanes, Cross, Ball, Tiny Ball.
- **23:02** Front of Floor saved for every mover. The Scan 110s were set by the geometry formula on the first try, then the Spots and Scan 360s by camera iteration.
- **23:10** Pocket Beam plugged in at 27 (13ch) and patched as "F Pocket Beam 27", Mover Tertiary G2. F4 renamed and regrouped.
- **23:23** Tiny Ball position created. Tony steered the Pocket Beam onto the tiny ball himself.
- **23:28** Vortex tested: static white dots at full, and Barrel Rotation 65 gives a medium spin.
- **23:30** Probable accidental Perform-mode "Import from Control One". The patch and positions were checked and are intact.
- **23:49** "Vortex Show" static look made (Show 134 + barrel spin). Tony: "it looks good".

## 2026-10-06
- **00:00** Back of Floor and Cross positions made from geometry. The Pocket Beam was put on the tiny ball in every position.
- **00:05** Position cues added to all 8 Bank 1 Autoloops. Project and lightshow saved. Left running on Bank 1 for Tony to review.
- **17:55** Repo created from the session notes.
- **18:50** Ring "Dance floor" camera mounted on the back wall; its Live View in Chrome replaces the iPhone/Photo Booth feed (not mirrored; night vision; Live View times out every ~5 min and needs Reconnect clicked). Claude can only view Chrome, not click it.
- **19:08** Back of Floor checked: L1/R1 and L2/R2 were crossing past each other, so their tilt was lowered; L3 small trim; front-bar Spots tilted toward the ball; Scan 360s land together. Saved.
- **19:55** Ring Live View moved to Claude's built-in browser so Claude can reconnect it. Cross checked pair by pair (L1/R1, L2/R2, Spots, Scan 360s) and widened into a proper X with separate pools. L3 got the same change as L2 but wasn't checked alone. Saved.
- **~20:10** Lanes position made and checked with Tony's phone photos (first try too close to the centerline; Scan 110 tilt lowered). Saved. Tony: target music is dance, tech house and 80s.
- **~20:15** Ball: the Spot beam is too wide for the big ball and there's no iris. Gobo sweep on Spot 1, filmed by Tony: 7 gobos plus open, including the custom **841 logo** at value 36 (the basement's nickname, Spot 1 only). No tight-dot gobo. Shopping idea: another LED pinspot for the ball.
- **20:28** Pocket Beam Ball aim was 180° off. Swung the pan 180° in software, then Tony dragged it onto the big ball himself. Little ball still perfect. Saved.
- **20:33** New "841 Logo" position: Spot 1 nearly straight down in front of the speakers.
- **20:39** The logo wouldn't focus well on the floor, so Tony moved it onto the white wall behind the bar and focused it. It read upside down; the Spot 255 can't index gobo rotation, so a slow spin (Gobo Rotation 10) was added instead. Tony: "Perfect." Saved.
- **20:46** Tony may turn the mini bar into a DJ booth. A Spot position on the mini bar is for later.
- **20:51** "841" static look made in Bank 4 (row 2, slot 3): the spinning logo on its own, to switch on over any Autoloop. Saved.
- **21:01** Talked through how positions, static looks and Autoloops interact (now in `soundswitch-guide.md`). With no Autoloop playing and no look holding it, the Pocket Beam sits at home, pointing straight up.
- **21:06** "Mirror Ball" static look made in Bank 4 (row 2, slot 4): Saber on the big ball, Pocket Beam on the little ball. Tony: "perfect". Saved.
- **21:08** After the save, SoundSwitch stopped responding with the Edit-mode File menu open on screen. Left it alone (Import and Export to Control One sit in that menu) and asked Tony to check.
- **21:14** Tony force-quit and reopened SoundSwitch. Everything saved came back (Bank 4: CAL Test, Vortex Show, 841, Mirror Ball). The window now opens larger, so screen coordinates moved.
- **21:14** The DJ booth is now set up at the front of the dance floor, on the left seen from the back (Tony's "stage right", standing behind the front bar). To-do: check for a second 841 gobo to project onto it.
- **21:21** Tried a second 841 look on the DJ booth with Spot 1. Spot 1 can't aim there, so it was aborted. Left behind, unsaved: a "DJ Booth" position (Cancel doesn't remove a new position) and an empty look "99".
- **22:10** Fixed F2's color order: made the "Intimidator Scan 360 Claude" profile (same ID as the stock one, wheel recolored to the newer order) and ran Update Fixtures with Tony's OK. It updated 2 fixtures; F2 and F4 lost their names and groups, and both were restored (Mover Primary G2). The yellow test then showed yellow on both, and F2 still landed on Floor Center. Saved.
- **22:11** Demo set up: Bank 1 Autoloops plus Mirror Ball, 841 and Vortex Show.
- **22:15** Tony: pressing Black leaves the Vortex running during Vortex Show.
- **22:23** Tony's Autoloop feedback: color changes are too fast; respect the color wheels; build "active looks" (one look, one color, one feeling) instead of animations. Now in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **22:24** Tony: consider how each light looks in space with the others; use lights individually and cleverly instead of everything on all the time. Added to `CLAUDE.md`.
- **22:25** Tony programs in stacks: a bank is a stack of looks that transition well into each other. EDM and 80s sit apart, in separate banks, with no transitions between them.
- **22:31** Tony left the Mac awake (caffeinate) for overnight work, in working copies Claude-2230 / Claude-2330.
- **22:41-22:54** Tony's direction: coordinated palettes, not random colors; follow LD best practice; treat lights as objects that interact. A research pass and his references (the orchestra post, Ultra main stage, Mau P, Carl Cox) went into `design-research.md`.
- **23:00-23:45** Built all 8 Bank 1 Autoloops by hand (`stacks.md`, "What got built"). Saved in Claude-2330.ssproj. Claude.ssproj is untouched.
- **23:46-23:57** Built five 80s looks at the top of Bank 2. Checkpoint saved as Claude-0000.ssproj. Gobo attribute cues are left for the morning, since the presets are global.

## 2026-10-07
- **06:13** Tony: the basement nightclub is called **Studio 841**. The 841 logo can be used in Autoloops if it's strategic. He asked about QLC+; research is in `notes/qlcplus.md`.
- **07:23** Tony decided against QLC+ ("kind of a hot mess"). Staying on SoundSwitch.
- **18:36** Tony's review notes on the overnight build are in `CLAUDE.md` and `stacks.md`. Banks hold 32 Autoloops each, so the 80s looks sit in Bank 1 slots 9-13. Before more building, Tony will research the new Autoloop features and program a scene for Claude to watch.
- **~21:00** Tony, going to bed: build tonight in another bank so the old looks stay for comparison; research the new Autoscript for Autoloops; make Vortex Show slow / medium / fast; put a pulse on the 841 logo. He pre-approved a Vortex profile update if one was needed.
- **~21:05** Working copy saved as **Claude-2100.ssproj**. Claude-0000 is untouched.
- **~21:15** Vortex Slow / Medium / Fast static looks made (Bank 4, row 4). The Vortex profile already exposed Show Speed, so no Fixture Manager change or Update Fixtures was needed. "841 Fade" static look made (row 3, slot 2): a static look can't pulse, so it fades in and out over 2 s instead. Saved.
- **~21:25** Autoscript research in `notes/autoscript.md` (web plus the dialog itself).
- **~21:30** SoundSwitch froze while scrolling the Autoscript preset dropdown. Force-quit through Activity Monitor (Tony's computer-use approval covered it) and reopened. Nothing saved was lost.
- **21:40-22:25** Round 2 EDM stack built in **Bank 3 slots 1-8** with Autoscript plus hand edits, applying Tony's notes (`stacks.md`, "Round 2"). New attribute cues: Prism Spots + 360s, 841 Logo Gobo, Spots Clean. "R2 7 841 Breakdown" has the pulsing 841 logo on Spot 1. Saved after every loop. Confirmed the 80s looks really are in Bank 1 slots 9-13. **Nothing checked on the lights.**

## 2026-10-20
- **07:03** Tony shared a Facebook thread: the Intimidator Spot 110 has no open/closed shutter, so it stays on unless the dimmer goes to 0. Same family as our Scan 110s and their idle glow. He also wants the Scan 110 gobos mapped to colors (the 110 is white only).
- **07:41** Tony isn't at the MacBook and wants this done in Claude Code there. Handoff written: `notes/handoff-scan110-profile.md` (DMX chart, the going-dark fix, a proposed gobo-to-color table, doing it in code, Update Fixtures steps). Update Fixtures is not yet approved for this job.
- **14:10** Tony lost this morning's chats. Recovered from the repo: the handoff (PR #1) was merged, the Vortex was added to it, and it was renamed `notes/handoff-fixture-profiles.md`. Manuals saved in `manuals/` at Tony's request: Vortex user manual, Scan 110 QRG and user manual, Spot 255 IRC QRG and user manual. From the Vortex manual: ch3 is a gobo / color wheel of colored gobos, ch5 Shutter has a real closed range (0-31), ch6 is the dimmer, and there are only 6 built-in shows (current Show 134 = Show 4). The Scan 110 QRG pictures its 8 gobos. Update Fixtures is still not approved.
